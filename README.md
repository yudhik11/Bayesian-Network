# Bayes-Networks
This is the modelling of the textile production Bayes' network showing belief nets in action.

# Problem Statement
You are the product manager of factory involved in textile production. Production of a textile in
a factory is dependent on several factors - like user base, demand, supply, labour costs,
manufacturing costs, utility of the clothing item being produced, transportation costs, etc.
Imagine you are the Production Manager of a leading factory.
Design a bayes net for the production of a textile(s) of your choice.

# Deliverables
1. A diagram of the Bayesâ€™ net.
2. Conditional Probability Tables for all dependencies.
3. A justification behind the reasons for your choosing different probabilities for different
nodes.
4. A solved query of the form P (X | p(X), p(p(X)) ) where p(X) is the parent of node X.
